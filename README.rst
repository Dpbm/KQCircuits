**KQCircuits** is a Python library developed by IQM for automating the design of
superconducting quantum circuits. It uses the `KLayout <https://klayout.de>`__ layout design program
API.

KQCircuits generates multi-layer 2-dimensional-geometry representing common structures in quantum
processing units (QPU). It includes definitions of parametrized geometrical objects or “elements”,
framework to easily define your own elements, framework to get geometry from the elements by setting
values to parameters and a framework to assemble a full QPU design by combining many of the elements
in different geometrical relations. Among other templates, are also structures to combine QPU
designs to create optical mask layout and EBL patterns for fabrication of quantum circuits and
export a set of files for a mask as needed for QPU fabrication.

Getting started
---------------

KQCircuits is a KLayout extension. KLayout can be used either using a graphical user interface or as
a standalone python module. For the first time users,
the graphical user interface (GUI) mode is recommended.

Video tutorials for the GUI installation can be found on YouTube.

Install GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^

`First install KLayout <https://www.klayout.de/build.html>`__.
(For mac users we recommend using `HomeBrew <https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/klayout>`__).
Afterwards you can install KQCircuits as a plug-in to use KQCircuits features
within your KLayout GUI editor session.

Salt installation
"""""""""""""""""

To quickly try out KQCircuits GUI features we recommend installing the Salt package of KQCircuits
inside your KLayout application.
The Salt package is easier to install and get started, but the built-in elements cannot be modified.
`See Salt installation guide here  <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/salt.html>`__.

Developer setup
"""""""""""""""

The developer setup is recommended for advanced users who want to modify KQCircuits code and to contribute to the project.

After installing KLayout run:

.. code-block:: console

   python setup_within_klayout.py

For further details see the `developer setup
documentation <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/developer/setup.html>`__.

Install standalone python module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing KQCircuits as a standalone python module allows you to use KQCircuits features
in your own python code with:

.. code-block:: console

   import kqcircuits

You will also get access to kqc related terminal commands such as:

.. code-block:: console

   kqc mask quick_demo.py              # To build a wafer mask, in this case quick_demo.py
   kqc sim waveguides_sim_compare.py   # To export and run waveguide simulation

For standalone installation run command

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install -e "klayout_package/python[docs,tests,sim]"

For improved security you can also validate the fetched dependencies of KQCircuits.
Further details available in the `documentation
<https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/developer/standalone.html>`__.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for KQCircuits can be found `here <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/>`__.

It may also be generated from the sources with ``make html`` in the docs directory.

Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^

Follow the `User Guide <https://iqm-finland.github.io/KQCircuits/user_guide/index.html>`__ for tutorials.

Simulations
-----------

   :width: 350

KQC currently supports exporting to **Ansys HFSS/Q3D (also with pyEPR)**, **Sonnet**, and **Elmer**.

Parameter sweeps are easy to implement, for example

.. code-block:: python

   simulations = sweep_simulation(layout, sim_class, sim_parameters, {
       'cpl_length': [160, 180, 200],
       'arm_width': [24, 28, 32, 36],
   })

exports simulations with the given individual parameters varied roughly as in the animation.

A sweep of all possible combinations between the given parameters is done by changing the function to
``cross_sweep_simulation``.
Check `klayout_package/python/scripts/simulations <https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits/tree/main/klayout_package/python/scripts/simulations>`__
for example simulation exports.
